Course:
ITT103

Purpose of code:

The purpose of this program is to create a basic program that enables administrators to add courses, register students, enroll students within courses and manage payments.

Since this program is a basic use of a registration and payment system it would most likely not be used for prefessional use with a huge amount of data. Below I show some limitations of this system

Lmimitations:
1. Allows user to enter numbers for names and special chracters
2. Will allow user to have a different course ID but with same course name 


How to run:

Insert the (code) into your IDE and hit control + enter to run

Once the code is active a menu should be displayed

Menu:

1. Register Student
2. Add Course
3. Enroll Student within a Course
4. All courses
5. Student Balance
6. Registered Students
7. Students within a course
8. Payments
9. Exit
